PLAYOFF FANTASY AI STRATEGY FILE
League Type: NFL Playoff One-and-Done (Use Each Player Once)
Scoring:
- PPR: 1.0 for all positions
- Tight End Premium: 1.5 PPR
- Standard yardage and TD scoring otherwise
Objective:
- Maximize TOTAL fantasy points across ALL playoff weeks
- Players can only be used once; once used they are locked
- Player pool shrinks as teams are eliminated

--------------------------------------------------
CORE STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES
--------------------------------------------------

1. VALUE VS LONGEVITY TRADEOFF
Do NOT always select the highest projected scorer for the current week.
Balance:
- Expected fantasy points THIS week
- Probability the player's NFL team advances to future rounds
High-value players on teams likely to advance should often be SAVED.

2. ADVANCEMENT PROBABILITY MATTERS
Each player's value should be multiplied by the probability their team plays that week.
Example:
EffectiveValue = ProjectedPoints × TeamAdvanceProbability

3. ELIMINATION-AWARE USAGE
Players on underdog teams:
- Higher priority to use early
- Fewer future opportunities
Players on Super Bowl contenders:
- Preserve elite options for later rounds

--------------------------------------------------
POSITIONAL STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------

TIGHT ENDS (1.5 PPR):
- Elite TEs have inflated value
- Treat top-tier TEs closer to WR1 value
- Scarcity increases in later rounds → plan usage carefully

RUNNING BACKS:
- Prefer pass-catching RBs (PPR)
- RBs on heavy favorites gain value due to game script
- RB injuries increase backup value rapidly

WIDE RECEIVERS:
- Target high-volume route runners
- Favor WRs in high-total games
- Slot WRs gain value vs weak zone defenses

QUARTERBACKS:
- Stack with pass-catchers when possible
- Mobile QBs gain floor value
- Avoid bad-weather games when alternatives exist

--------------------------------------------------
MATCHUP & CONTEXT FACTORS
--------------------------------------------------

Each weekly evaluation should include:
- Opponent defense vs position rank
- Game total (expected points)
- Point spread (favorite vs underdog)
- Weather (wind, snow, heavy rain reduce passing efficiency)
- Injury reports & snap share expectations

--------------------------------------------------
VOLATILITY MANAGEMENT
--------------------------------------------------

Score players using:
- Floor (safe points)
- Ceiling (upside)
- Variance (boom/bust risk)

Early rounds:
- Favor safe floors
Later rounds:
- Ceiling matters more if chasing points

--------------------------------------------------
GAME THEORY CONSIDERATIONS
--------------------------------------------------

- Opponents will likely save elite players on strong teams
- Using a player removes them from your future pool but not others
- Do not over-save: unused players score ZERO

--------------------------------------------------
RECOMMENDED DECISION FRAMEWORK
--------------------------------------------------

For each player and week, calculate:

UtilityScore =
(ExpectedFantasyPoints × TeamAdvanceProbability)
+ FutureValueAdjustment
- OpportunityCost

Where:
- FutureValueAdjustment increases for elite players on strong teams
- OpportunityCost increases if position scarcity is high later

--------------------------------------------------
REQUIRED DATA INPUTS
--------------------------------------------------

The AI should ingest:
- Weekly fantasy projections (playoff weeks only)
- Team win probabilities & Super Bowl odds
- Defense vs position rankings
- Injury status and depth charts
- Weather forecasts
- Player volatility metrics
- Scoring weights (TE = 1.5 PPR)

--------------------------------------------------
FINAL GUIDING RULE
--------------------------------------------------

This is NOT DFS.
The goal is maximizing TOTAL playoff points, not weekly wins.
Using the right player at the wrong time is worse than using a slightly worse player at the right time.
